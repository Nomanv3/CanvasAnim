# CanvasAnim
Frame Animation with GSAP and Canvas: This project uses HTML5 Canvas and GSAP's ScrollTrigger to create a frame-by-frame animation controlled by the user's scroll position. Images are preloaded and rendered dynamically on the canvas as you scroll, providing a smooth and responsive visual experience.
